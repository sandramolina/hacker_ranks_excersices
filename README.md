1. Counting Valleys
   An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly steps, for every step it was noted if it was an uphill, , or a downhill, step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

A mountain is a sequence of consecutive steps above sea level, starting with a step up from sea level and ending with a step down to sea level.
A valley is a sequence of consecutive steps below sea level, starting with a step down from sea level and ending with a step up to sea level.
Given the sequence of up and down steps during a hike, find and print the number of valleys walked through.

Example
c= [0,1,0,0,0,1,0]
The hiker first enters a valley units deep. Then they climb out and up onto a mountain units high. Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.

2. Jumpin on Clouds
   There is a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds. Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus. The player can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the number of the current cloud plus or . The player must avoid the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take to jump from the starting postion to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game.

For each game, you will get an array of clouds numbered if they are safe or if they must be avoided.

Example

Index the array from . The number on each cloud is its index in the list so the player must avoid the clouds at indices and . They could follow these two paths: or . The first path takes jumps while the second takes . Return .

Function Description

Complete the jumpingOnClouds function in the editor below.

jumpingOnClouds has the following parameter(s):

int c[n]: an array of binary integers
Returns

int: the minimum number of jumps required
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the total number of clouds. The second line contains space-separated binary integers describing clouds where .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the minimum number of jumps needed to win the game.
